📨 Referral Mail Automation Tool – Project Description

Built a real-world automation tool that sends personalized referral request emails automatically.

The tool reads recipient details (name, email, title, company) from a CSV file and sends emails with a personalized message and resume attached.

Used Java and Jakarta Mail API to handle secure email sending through SMTP with SSL authentication.

Designed to save time by replacing manual email sending with a fully automated process.

Each email feels personally written — recipient’s name and company appear in bold for a professional touch.

Entire logic written in a single Java file, focusing on simplicity and learning the complete flow end-to-end.

In a real-world setup, this can be modularized — separating code into packages (for mail, templates, logging, etc.) — to follow professional development standards.

Represents one complete corner of an enterprise-level automation project — showing the full process from input to automated output.
